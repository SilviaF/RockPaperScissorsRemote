This code was developed by Silvia Figueroa for the position of Java Developer at Knockout Gaming.

The functionality goes like this:
1- The program will prompt the user for a mode of play, this being either Fair, Unfair or Remote.
2- User will enter "fair", "unfair" or "remote" according to his/her preferences via command line.
3- Game will start automatically. Depending on the previous choice, player2 will always select Rock (unfair), select a random option locally (fair) or select a random option remotely (remote).
4- A total of 10 iterations of the game will be executed, each one showing the move of each player and the result.
5- At the end of these 10 iterations, game stats will be displayed showing how many wins each player has and how many games ended in draw.
